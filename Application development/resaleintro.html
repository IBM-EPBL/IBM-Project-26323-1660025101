        <p>With difficult economic conditions,it is likely that sales of reconditioned second-hand cars will increase.In most of the countries,it is common to lease to lease a car rather than buying it outright.A lease is a binding contract between a buyer and a seller in which the buyer must pay fixed instalments for a pre defined number of months/years to the seller/financer.After the lease period is over,the buyer has the possibility to buy the car at its residual value,i.e.its expected resale value.Thus,this application is of commercial interest to seller/financers to be able to predict the residual value of cars with accuracy.</p>
